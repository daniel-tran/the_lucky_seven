# The Lucky Seven - Virtual Edition
An unofficial browser version of "[The Lucky Seven](https://coincidence.games/the-lucky-seven/)" by Coincidence.

# Recommended devices
This game is best played on either a standard 16:9 display such as a desktop monitor or on a tablet device.

# Play locally
Prerequisites: Node.js 18 or higher is installed on your machine

To play on your own machine, simply run `setup.bat` (only required when running the game for the first time) and then the `run.bat` script. This should start a local web server on your machine in which http://localhost:777 will be the URL that loads the game.

When running on a non-Windows environment, open up the Command Prompt equivalent on your local machine, navigate to this directory and run `npm ci` and `npm run start` instead of `setup.bat` and `run.bat` respectively.

# Rule Adjustments
The Settings button, or the button with the spanner icon, will allow certain elements of the game to be configurable.

Applying any changes will start a new game with the configured settings applied.
