# Play locally
Prerequisites: Node.js 18 or higher is installed on your machine

To play on your own machine, simply run `setup.bat` (only required when running the game for the first time) and then the `run.bat` script. This should start a local web server on your machine in which http://localhost:777 will be the URL that loads the game.

When running on a non-Windows environment, open up the Command Prompt equivalent on your local machine, navigate to this directory and run `npm ci` and `npm run start` instead of `setup.bat` and `run.bat` respectively.

# Rule Adjustments
The Settings button, or the button with the spanner icon, will allow certain elements of the game to be configurable.

Applying any changes will start a new game with the configured settings applied.

# Disclaimer
This open source project is not endorsed by nor affiliated with Coincidence. Consequently, this project is not guaranteed to remain up to date with any modifications to the official rules of "The Lucky Seven".
